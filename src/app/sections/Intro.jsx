          The rapid evolution of generative AI and intelligent agents is
          transforming how we interact with, understand, and visualize data. As
          these technologies continue to advance, we stand at the frontier of
          new visualization paradigms that will shape the future of the VIS
          community.

          VISxGenAI brings together researchers, practitioners, and innovators
          exploring the intersection of generative AI, autonomous agents, and
          visualization. Our workshop aims to address critical questions: How
          can visualization techniques evolve to collaborate with AI systems?
          What novel interfaces will emerge in agent-augmented analytics? How
          might generative AI reshape visualization authoring and consumption?
