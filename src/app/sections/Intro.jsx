        The rapid evolution of generative AI and intelligent agents is
        transforming how we interact with, understand, and visualize data. As
        these technologies continue to advance, we stand at the frontier of new
        visualization paradigms that will shape the future of the VIS community.

        VISxGenAI brings together researchers, practitioners, and innovators
        exploring the intersection of generative AI, autonomous agents, and
        visualization. Our workshop aims to address critical questions: How can
        visualization techniques evolve to collaborate with AI systems? What
        novel interfaces will emerge in agent-augmented analytics? How might
        generative AI reshape visualization authoring and consumption?
